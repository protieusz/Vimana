QMK source code is updated to QMK 0.19.  

Trackball movements, mouse button 1 & 2 and scroll lock all works.

The only thing I have not got it working is the OLED display. I have to find time to fix it or someone can help fix it.

I will provide both the source code and the hex file to this repository.

Enjoy and good luck!
