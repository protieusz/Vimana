# Vimana
A 40% Handwired Ortho Keeb with a 35mm Meshi Trackball Module in the middle in a shape of a Vimana.

What is a Vimana? As per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vimana, it is the following: 
"VimƒÅna are mythological flying palaces or chariots described in Hindu texts and Sanskrit epics. The "Pushpaka Vimana" of Ravana (who took it from Kubera; Rama returned it to Kubera) is the most quoted example of a vimana. Vimanas are also mentioned in Jain texts."

This is my interpretation of the Vimana keeb layout. BEHOLD!!! The VIMANA!
